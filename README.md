# Proteomics-Expression-Analysis-using-peptide-intensity-data-derived-from-scaffold-DIA
Analysis of protein intensity data to determine differentially expressed proteins between normal kidney cells and normal kidney cells overexpressing certain proteins. 
Variance stabilization normalization approach was adopted for this analysis. DEP R package was used.
